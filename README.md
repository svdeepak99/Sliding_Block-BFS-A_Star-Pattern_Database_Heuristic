# Sliding_Block-BFS-A_Star-Pattern_Database_Heuristic
Solving Sliding Block Puzzle using BFS, A* & Pattern Database Heuristic.
- Built a Sliding Block Puzzle Environment and used BFS and A* Searches to find the best possible answer.
- Designed a Patten Heuristic database with an unending BFS search that began at the objective and proceeded to all of the states that could be reached from there.
- Obtained 1.28x & 937x speedups using A* with Manhattan Distance & Pattern Database Heuristics (where 1x is the speed of BFS).

### The file descriptions are as follows:
1) [**Sliding_Block_BFS.py**](Sliding_Block_BFS.py) - BFS Algorithm
2) [**Sliding_Block_AStar.py**](Sliding_Block_AStar.py) - A* Algorithm using Manhattan Distance
3) [**Sliding_Block_AStar_DBS.py**](Sliding_Block_AStar_DBS.py) - A* Algorthm with Pattern Database Heuristic
4) [**Pattern_Database_3x3.py**](Pattern_Database_3x3.py) & [**Pattern_Database_3x3.py**](Pattern_Database_3x3.py) - Files used to generate the Pattern Databases
5) The remaning files are the Pattern Databases and the test cases

**Note:** The Algorithms, Outputs & Performances of the programs can be found in the [**Report.pdf**](Report.pdf) file.
